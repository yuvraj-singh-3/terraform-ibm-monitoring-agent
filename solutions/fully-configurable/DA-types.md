## `metrics_filter`

The `metrics_filter` variable allows you to control which custom metrics are collected by the IBM Cloud Monitoring agent. You can specify patterns to **include** or **exclude** certain metrics, giving you fine-grained control over the data sent to IBM Cloud Monitoring.

### Type

```hcl
type = list(object({
  include = optional(string)
  exclude = optional(string)
}))
```

### Description

- **Purpose:**
  Use `metrics_filter` to specify which metrics to include or exclude from collection. This is useful for reducing noise, focusing on relevant metrics, or optimizing resource usage.

- **How it works:**
  Each entry in the list can have an `include` or `exclude` field (or both).
  - The value should be a string pattern (supports wildcards, e.g., `metricA.*`).
  - `exclude` takes precedence over `include` if both match a metric.

- **Default:**
  ```hcl
  default = []
  ```
  By default, no filtering is applied—all metrics are collected.

### Example Usage

```hcl
[
  { exclude = "kube_pod_container_status_terminated_reason_oomkilled" },
  { include = "custom_metric_prefix.*" }
]
```

- The above configuration will:
  - Exclude all metrics matching `kube_pod_container_status_terminated_reason_oomkilled`
  - Include all metrics starting with `custom_metric_prefix.`

**Tip:**
Use `metrics_filter` to optimize your monitoring setup by collecting only the metrics that matter most to your use case. This can help reduce costs and improve performance.

## `prometheus_config`

The `prometheus_config` variable allows you to enable sysdig agent to scrape metrics from processes that expose Prometheus metric endpoints on its own host and send findings to the Sysdig collector for storing and further processing.

### Type

```hcl
map(any)
```

### Example Usage

```hcl
{
  scrape_configs = [
    {
      job_name = "testing-prometheus-scrape"
      tls_config = {
        insecure_skip_verify = true
      }
      kubernetes_sd_configs = [
        {
          role = "pod"
        }
      ]
      relabel_configs = [
        {
          action = "keep"
          source_labels = ["__meta_kubernetes_pod_host_ip"]
          regex = "__HOSTIPS__"
        },
        {
          action = "drop"
          source_labels = ["__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_promcat_sysdig_com_omit"]
          regex = "true"
        },
        {
          source_labels = ["__meta_kubernetes_pod_phase"]
          action = "keep"
          regex = "Running"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
